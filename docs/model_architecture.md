# Model Architecture and Layer Training Strategy

## Overview
This document explains the architectural decisions and layer training strategy used in our requirements classification model.

## Layer Training Configuration

Our model uses a 6-layer training approach (training layers 6-11) based on empirical studies and domain-specific considerations:

### Layer Roles in Language Models
1. Lower Layers (0-5, Frozen)
   - Capture basic linguistic patterns
   - Handle syntax and basic semantics
   - Generally transfer well across domains
   - Freezing prevents catastrophic forgetting

2. Middle Layers (6-8, Trainable)
   - Process domain-specific terminology
   - Adapt to technical writing styles
   - Learn requirements-specific patterns
   - Bridge between language and domain

3. Upper Layers (9-11, Trainable)
   - Specialize in requirements classification
   - Learn complex technical relationships
   - Handle domain-specific abstractions
   - Direct input to classification head

### Why 6 Layers?

The choice of training 6 layers (versus 4 or all 12) is based on:

1. Technical Requirements Context
   - Technical documentation uses specialized language
   - Complex domain relationships need deeper adaptation
   - Engineering terms require contextual understanding

2. Model Performance Considerations
   - Better balance between generalization and specialization
   - Reduced risk of overfitting compared to full fine-tuning
   - Maintains base model's linguistic capabilities
   - More robust to variations in requirement styles

3. Computational Efficiency
   - Faster training than full model fine-tuning
   - Lower memory requirements
   - Better for iterative improvements

## Domain-Specific Adaptations

### Engineering Requirements
- Benefits from 6-layer training due to:
  - Complex technical terminology
  - Structured document formats
  - Specific regulatory patterns
  - Inter-requirement relationships

### Software Requirements
- Middle layers adapt to:
  - Programming concepts
  - System architectures
  - Technical constraints
  - Implementation details

### Safety Requirements
- Upper layers specialize in:
  - Critical condition identification
  - Compliance patterns
  - Risk assessment language
  - Safety standard terminology

## Model Performance Impact

### Advantages
1. Better domain adaptation
2. Improved handling of technical terms
3. More robust classification
4. Maintained general language understanding

### Trade-offs
1. Slightly longer training time than 4-layer
2. Higher memory usage
3. More complex model management

## Future Considerations

1. Domain-specific layer configurations
2. Dynamic layer freezing based on dataset size
3. Performance monitoring per layer
4. Adaptive training strategies
